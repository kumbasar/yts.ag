Title    : Sons of Ben
Year     : 2016
Rating   : 7.7
Summary  : After many rumors of an MLS team arriving in Philadelphia never
           materializing, a small group of soccer fans took matters into their own
           hands and started a supporters group called the Sons of Ben to help
           bring a team to their hometown. They were a group without a team to root
           for and had a modest goal of reaching 100 members by the end of the
           year. Little did they know they would reach over 1,500 members in less
           time than that and start a movement that would not only change the
           soccer landscape in Philadelphia forever, but also help revive a
           community that had been struggling for decades.

Title    : The Redeemed and the Dominant: Fittest on Earth
Year     : 2018
Rating   : 7.1
Summary  : In 2017 the fittest athletes on Earth took on the unknown and unknowable
           during four of the most intense days of competition in CrossFit Games
           history. "The Redeemed and the Dominant: Fittest on Earth " captures all
           the drama as top athletes resembling chiseled Grecian gods descend on
           Madison, Wisconsin, to face a series of trials. Hercules faced 12; they
           take on 13. Emotions run high as a throng of Australian athletes rise to
           the top. By the end of the competition, some learn tough lessons-that
           all that glitters isn't gold, or even bronze-and some learn that they're
           even stronger than they realized. The best among them enter the pantheon
           of CrossFit giants and earn the right to call themselves the "Fittest on
           Earth."
